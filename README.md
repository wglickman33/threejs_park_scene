This is my first ever project using ThreeJS, created as a learning experience to understand 3D graphics programming in the browser. It's a serene interactive park environment built with ThreeJS and React that demonstrates my journey into 3D web development.

## 🌄 About The Park Scene

The central component of this project is `ParkScene.jsx`, which creates an immersive outdoor environment where users can:

- Explore a naturalistic park setting with trees, benches, and paths
- Experience a dynamic day-night cycle with changing lighting and atmosphere
- Observe realistic water features including lakes, ponds, and a central fountain
- Navigate the scene using orbit controls with zoom and rotation capabilities

The scene includes procedurally positioned elements like trees (organized in natural clusters), benches placed strategically along paths, and water features with realistic ripples and reflections. The environment responds to the time of day with appropriate lighting changes, fog effects, and sky colors to create a compelling atmosphere.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Realistic Environment** with varied trees, benches, and natural elements
- **Dynamic Day-Night Cycle** with changing lighting, colors, and atmosphere
- **Smooth Water Features** with gentle ripples, reflective surfaces, and natural shorelines
- **User Controls** including orbit camera controls and time adjustment
- **Component-Based Architecture** showcasing React integration with ThreeJS
- **Responsive Design** adapting to different screen sizes

## 🛠️ Technical Learning Journey

This project represents my first deep dive into 3D graphics programming, where I learned:

- Setting up a ThreeJS scene within a React component structure
- Creating and managing 3D objects, materials, and lighting
- Implementing camera controls and user interaction
- Working with animations and dynamic scene elements
- Managing performance with proper resource cleanup and optimization techniques
- Using advanced techniques like fog, shadows, and reflections

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wglickman33/threejs_park_scene.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## 🎮 Controls

- **Mouse Drag**: Orbit around the scene
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in and out
- **SPACE**: Toggle camera auto-rotation
- **T**: Toggle between normal and fast time progression
- **UI Display**: Shows current time and controls information

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering engine (my first project using this technology)
- **React**: UI framework and component structure
- **React Hooks**: For ThreeJS integration and state management
- **Vite**: Build tool and development environment

## 💭 Personal Reflections

This project represents my first steps into the world of 3D web development. Before this, I had never worked with ThreeJS or any 3D graphics programming. The learning curve was steep, but incredibly rewarding as I watched the park environment come to life.

Some key challenges I overcame included:

- Understanding 3D coordinate systems and object positioning
- Creating realistic water effects that performed well
- Implementing a day-night cycle with appropriate lighting changes
- Managing the complexity of multiple interactive elements in a single scene

## 🔍 What I Learned

Through building this project, I gained valuable skills in:

- 3D graphics fundamentals and ThreeJS implementation
- Creating responsive and interactive 3D environments
- Optimizing performance for complex scenes
- Integrating 3D content with React components
- Problem-solving complex visual and technical challenges
